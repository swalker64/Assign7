    <h2>Distribution, Habitat and Reproduction</h2>
    <h3>Populations</h3>
    <img src="img/wildquail.jpg" alt="Alternate Text" />
    <p>Populations of the Japanese quail are known to mainly inhabit East Asia and Russia. This includes India, Korea, Japan, and China.[3][4][5] Though several resident populations of this quail have been shown to winter in Japan, most migrate south to areas such as Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and southern China.[6] This quail has also been found to reside in many parts of Africa, including Tanzania, Malawi, Kenya, Namibia, Madagascar, and the area of the Nile River Valley extending from Kenya to Egypt.[5]</p>
    <h3>Breeding Sites</h3>
    <p>Breeding sites of the Japanese quail are largely localized to East and Central Asia,[3][4] in such areas as Manchuria, southeastern Siberia, northern Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. However, it has also been observed to breed in some regions of Europe, as well as Turkey.[5]</p>
    <h3>Habitat</h3>
    <p>The Japanese quail is primarily a ground-living species that tends to stay within areas of dense vegetation in order to take cover and evade predation.[7] Thus, its natural habitats include grassy fields, bushes along the banks of rivers, and agricultural fields that have been planted with crops such as oats, rice, and barley.[5][7] It has also been reported to prefer open habitats such as steppes, meadows, and mountain slopes near a water source.[8]</p>
    <h3>Reproduction</h3>
    <p>The type of relationship exhibited between male and female members of Coturnix japonica has returned mixed reports, as they have been seen to exhibit both monogamous and polygamousrelationships. Study of domesticated specimens reveals that females tend to bond with one to two males, though extra-pair copulations are also frequently observed.[10]</p>
    <p>The Japanese quail exhibits a quite distinct and specific mating ritual. First, the male will grab the neck of the female and mount her. After mounting the female, the male will extend his cloacaby curving his back in an attempt to initiate cloacal contact between him and the female. If cloacal contact is achieved, insemination of the female will be exhibited by distinguishable foam present in the female's cloaca. After successfully mating with a female, it is characteristic of the male to perform a distinctive strut. Females can either facilitate the mating attempts of the male by remaining still and squatting in order to ease the access of the male to her cloaca. Or, she can impede the attempts of the male by standing tall and running away from the mounting male.[11]Females can also induce the initial sexual interactions by walking in front of a male and crouching.[10] Males acting aggressively toward a female during the mating ritual has been shown to reduce successful matings.[11]</p>

    <p>The diet of the Japanese quail includes many different types of grass seed such as white millet and panicum. They also feed upon a variety of insects, their larvae, and other small invertebrates.[5]</p>
    <h3>Eating Habits</h3>
    <p>The Japanese quail mainly eats and drinks at the beginning and end of the day, this behavior shown to closely follow the photoperiod. However, they will still perform these actions throughout the day as well.[9]</p>
